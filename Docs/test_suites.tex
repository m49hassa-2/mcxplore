\section{Test Suites} 
We accompany \textit{MCxplore} with sets of regression tests to validate and evaluate most of the modern memory controller properties. 
Namely, we provide three test suites based on the model we use to generate this test suite. All test suites reside in the TestSuites subdirectory. 
Table~\ref{tb:suites} tabulates these test suites.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Test Suites\label{tb:suites}}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|p{11cm}|}
\hline
Suite & Model used & Description\\
\hline
regressionSuite & noMChk & this suite includes tests that cover all combinations of the configuration parameters in Table~\ref{tb:config_noMChk}\\
\hline 

PoliciesSuite & REQmdl & this suite includes tests that test most commonly used policies of commodity memory controllers such as page policies, address mapping and arbitration schemes.\\
\hline

TimingSuites & CMDmdl & this suite includes tests to detect any timing violations in most timing constraints\\
