\section{Complete Examples}
\subsection{Request Model Example}
Consider the test with $40\%$ bank interleaving and $20\%$ row locality, with the following LTL specification:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
LTLSPEC G !(total_hit=2 & total_bank_interleave=4 & total_requests=10)
\end{lstlisting} 
running the \textit{MCxplore} flow for this test invokes the NuSMV model checker, which produces an intermediate file called \textbf{\textit{REQmdl.bmc}}. 
The contents of the  \textbf{\textit{REQmdl.bmc}} are shown below.

This specific \textbf{\textit{REQmdl.bmc}} output illustrates that the bounded model checker runs for $10$ states ($0$ to $9$) until it reaches to a counter-example. 
This is clearly because we set the number of requests in the test to be $10$. 
Each state represents a unique request. 
The variables that maintain the same value as the previous state are not shown. 
For each address segment (row, column, ... etc.), it is either the "\textit{same}" or "\textit{diff}" compared to the previous request. 
all other variables in each state are counters to keep track of the address pattern. 
Afterwards, \textbf{\textit{REQmdl\_parser.pl}} parses this file and produces the required output test file as we show below. 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
0x00000000	R
0x00082000	R
0x00104000	R

\end{lstlisting} 

\subsection{Command Model Example}
Consider the test required to validate the $tRTP$ timing constraint, with the following LTL specification.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
G ! (((value_READ_TO_PRE_DELAY * num_READ_TO_PRE_DELAY + num_tCCD *
 value_tCCD + value_tRCD) > (value_tRAS)) & (num_READ_TO_PRE_DELAY > 0)
  & (num_Rx_d=0) & (num_Rd_s=0))
\end{lstlisting}
running the \textit{MCxplore} flow for this test invokes the NuSMV model checker, which produces an intermediate file called \textbf{\textit{CMDmdl.bmc}}. 
The contents of the  \textbf{\textit{CMDmdl.bmc}} are shown below.
